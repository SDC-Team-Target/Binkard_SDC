# System Design Capstone

Scaled an existing appliation by rebuilding the server and database
  
For this project I extended the capabilites of inherited code with a focus of supporting production-level web traffic. After researching PostgreSQL and MongoDB, I chose PostgreSQL for benchmarking.  After seeding the database with 10 million unique records generated by Faker.js, I began benchmark testing. Using Compound Indexing, I reduced the response times of finding an item by a static ID, by a random ID, and by username. 

I performed load testing with K6 and analyzed latency and throughput with New Relic. Below are some benchmarks I achieved: 

  * Queries executed in under 50ms

  * Generated and seeded a database with 10m documents

  * Maintained Error rate of 0% under a load of 1000 virtual users over a half-hour-long test
